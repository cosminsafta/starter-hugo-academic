title: Functional Tensor Network Approximations for Earth System Models

summary: Employ low-rank functional tensor network models for UQ in earth system models.

abstract: "Sensitivity analysis and model calibration studies for large scale models are challenged by both the large
computational cost and large number of parameters typically associated with these models. These challenges are
exacerbated by the non-linear input-output dependencies that limit the number of reduced-order techniques that
could be leveraged in these studies. In this work we focus on the E3SM land component, and we exploit its internal
structure to construct low-rank functional tensor network surrogates that model the spatio-temporal dependencies
for select quantities of interest. We present a set of functional representations and model construction techniques to
create parsimonious approximations commensurate with the flow of information between various model
components. We investigate the efficiency of this approach for uncertainty quantification studies at both regional
and global scales."
