Uncertainty quantification (UQ) and propagation methods are facing a number of challenges when dealing with climate models. The curse of dimensionality, manifested by both the large number of input parameters and dense spatio-temporal outputs, together with the computational expense and non-linear behavior of components of climate models necessitates UQ method development on top of off-the-shelf approaches. This minisymposium highlights recent work on forward UQ method development, including techniques for uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis, targeting the challenges above in the context of deployment for various components of earth system modeling.
